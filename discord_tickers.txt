OKYO setting up nicely again on the 1h time frame after we played this last week from $2.00 all the way to $3.30 for a 50%+ move!

Looks like they are bouncing off of their trendline and trying to continue the uptrend here, so this can be a good opportunity to get in some low risk adds!

This is another low floater thats been on an absolute TEAR this year, running over 1000%+ from $0.58 lows all the way to $8.00+ with <10M float!

They had a 50% drop from their highs recently and looks like they are starting to find some support, so these are nice potential levels to risk off of for another possible move back to $6-$8+!

Over $5.40 level is key for a breakout!

They had a HUGE 500% move earlier this year from $2.30 to $11.70+, so lets see if history can repeat itself from these levels!

The chart looks to be setting up again for some potential continuation here over the $2.60 key level, so over that has room to $2.80-$3.00+ next!

This is a reasonably low float ticker here with only 22M float! This one is trading right above the $1.90s demand zone and bounced at $2.00, even hitting $6.40+ after a 200%+ run from earlier this year! If history tends to repeat itself, we could have a nice slow-grinder swing opportunity from these levels down here!

The $1.00 area was where the stock ran 250%+ from $1.00 to $3.50+ last time, so there is potential we could see another big move from this level! 15m float here so this could be another nice slow-grind swing play!

DVLT play has a bigger float compared to the plays from last week, but has just as much potential as a nice MULTI-DAY SWING play!

They recently had a ticker change (formerly WISA), and have been holding a NICE uptrend in the last few weeks, and is looking prime to continue upward from here! This one has historically had nice moves on news like it did on February 12th, running from $1.14 to $1.74 for over 50% gains.

Lots of potential on this setup here so keep watch for the $1.25 continuation break!

This is the overnight play! Vision Marine was a play we previously covered in this channel that ran HUGE before, and looks like they just had some nice news earlier! They popped from $1.00 to $1.40 right at market close and did a round trip, back to the $1.00 support level! Watch for a potential move overnight from these low risk levels!

This is a oversold low floater that has been up-trending nicely for the last 2 weeks! We saw what $LUCY and $NVOS did in premarket as other cheap low float pennies, watch if this can gain some momentum as well.

Ticker: TGL @everyone 

Trading Plan:
— Add Zones: $5.20-$5.30s range
— Stop loss: Below $4.50
— Key Levels: $6.00 -> $6.20 -> $6.50+

RECENT CORPORATE UPDATES + TECHNICAL SETUP:
✅ - Recently performed a 1:70 Reverse Split as of Feb. 27th, 2024, reducing the total amount of outstanding shares from 110.1M shares to 1.4M shares, with the float being only 715,000. Once recent RS stock we have seen was BENF, going from $1.90 to $13.00, we could see some volume flow into this as it is still a low float RS stock from a few months ago.
📈 - Currently in an uptrend with multiple bounces on this trendline support, over $6.00 is a key level for a move up.

Ticker: ATNM

Price: $6.71

This is a potential DAY TRADE idea.

Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ATNM) focuses on developing targeted radiotherapies to improve survival for patients who have failed existing oncology therapies.

They are primarily positioned in the biotechnology sector. The company focuses on creating targeted radiotherapies that deliver cancer-killing radiation with cellular-level precision, addressing the needs of patients with high unmet medical requirements.

According to Market Research Future, the global radiotherapy market size was estimated to be $9.7 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $12.5 billion with a revenue CAGR of 4.2% by 2030.

ATNM has potential to become a significant player in the radiotherapy market, considering their unique approach to radiotherapy, positive results from their pivotal Phase 3 trial, and the high unmet needs combined with the market growth for radiotherapy.

Here are some Recent and Upcoming Catalysts for Actinium:

Iomab-B: Full Phase 3 completion and positive results announced in Feb. 2023 + Biologics License Application (BLA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) filings expected to be announced during 2024!

:checkbounce: - All patients were able to successfully access BMT with 100% engraftment
:checkbounce: - 75% of patients achieved an initial remission 30 days after their BMT compared to 6.3% of patients in the control group
:checkbounce: - 22% of the patients receiving Iomab-B maintained dCR lasting 180 days or more while none of the patients on the control arm achieved dCR
:checkbounce: - Orphan Drug designation granted to Iomab by the EU and FDA

Liquidity and Cash Burn:

🏦 - Around $62.4M in cash as of Feb. 2023 with -$3.7M cash burn every month, around 16-17 months of cash left so they should be good on cash through 2024 before they would have to raise capital through an offering.
⚠️ - They have an active S-3 filing from Feb. 2nd 2024 authorizing them to raise up to $500M from time to time thru stock and warrant offerings.

TRADING PLAN:

Add zones: $6.70s adds

S/L: Under $6.30

Key levels: $7.00 —> $7.20 —> $7.45

Make sure to respect the plan treat this as a a DAY TRADE idea.

9/28 TRADING PACKET;

Here is a breakdown of events on $BNOX today.

Share Structure Analysis;

Low float, low supply makes it is easier to push the stock.

Positive Phase 2 news. This is a good PR for biotech stock and is in line with the current theme of low float biotech plays you all have seen in the past week like $RNAZ, $SLNO, $DMK.

Psychological Structure;

This was the only PM runner was the only one that ran. If no other stocks run, all eyes will focus in on this and volume will collectively converge into this ticker.

Once it broke $1.40, aim for $1.50 -> $1.60 -> $2.00+ while staying green. That is the rule! Anything above $2.00 at that point is stress free as you ride rest of shares and you set your S/L at entry.

Remember that no one can call the top of the stock. Even if you didn’t manage to sell the top, be happy you’re green because there may be others who bought the top instead.
