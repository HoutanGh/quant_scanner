- different files for different models
- to get stock data, take input of stock and time
    - doesn't really need to take time as input just date because the data for the time is in the df
- models
    - moving averages
        - can only do up to 60 days with yfinance
    - BS model
    - ML model that incoporates all the other models then sees which factors contribute the most to the stock increasing or not
    - pairs trading that finds connections between pennies (seems pointless tho)
- data
    - volume 
    - voume increase/decrease rate
    - price
- scrapping discord
    - first just all the unique names of the stocks (use random time 1pm GMT)
    - distinguish first time post of the stocks
### Maybe end point of this program is to get weights of variables that have the biggest affect, then use these weights for a different model that says buy or not?
